## Basics of Cloud Native Technologies
### 1. Traditional/Legacy apps

Monolithic approach (self0contained and include all the functionality and components)
Pro: easy to develop and deploy
Con: hard to manage complexity, scale development across multiple teams, implement changes fast, scale the app out efficiently with a lot of load


### 2. Cloud native architecture 

break down your app in smaller pieces which makes them more manageable.


### 3. Characteristics of Cloud Native Architecture


* High Level of Automation\
  Achieved by using __Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines__ that are backed by a version control system like git. Building, testing and deploying apps and infrastructure with minimal human involvement allows for fast, frequent and incremental changes to production. Great for much easier disaster recovery.
* Self Healing\
  Monitor: health checks, compartmentalized applications
* Scalable\
  Application metrics: CPU or memory -> ensure availability and performance of your services
* Cost-Efficient\
  Scale down if traffic is low
* Easy to Maintain\
  __Microservices__ allows to break down apps in smaller pieces and make them more portable, easier to test and distribute
* Secure by default\
  Calls for different security models for different teams and users. For ex, __Zero trust computing__


## High level architecture of Kubernetes
## Container Orchestration (CO)
## How CO differes from legacy deployments 




## Deliver and monitor your app in a distributed system
